Etch-a-sketch project as part of TOP

This project combines HTML, CSS and vanilla JS to create a sketchpad that allows users to draw with their mouse pointer.

Each time the mouse pointer hovers over a cell within the grid, the respective cell will darken slightly, simulating the act of shading with a pencil.

Users can change the grid size by clicking on the 'Select grid size' button to adjust the thickness and precision of their sketches.

Users can erase their sketch to start with a new canvass by clicking on the 'Clear grid' button.
